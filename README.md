## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP-1 (Simple As Possible) computer, but with minimal changes so that the instruction format remains the same.
  
Credits are given to Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown for introducing this architecture in their book "Digital Computer Electronics" and Ben Eater for implementing his own version of the SAP Computer using IC's and breadboards.

An interesting fact is that I discovered a girl who made the SAP-1 computer using breadboards in October 2011, and Ben Eater in February 2015, so 4 years earlier! This is that video:

 She built the SAP-1 computer using breadboards for a school project. It's a pity that the video presented is not of better quality.
