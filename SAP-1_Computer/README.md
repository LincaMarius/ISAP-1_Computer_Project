# SAP-1 Computer
The SAP-1 computer is introduced as a teaching project by Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown in their book “Digital Computer Electronics”.

The description of its architecture and operation is presented in the book starting on Page 140 and the diagram starting on page 154. The Parts List is presented on page 501.

In this part of the project, I want to do an analysis of the SAP-1 computer.

## Block Diagram Analysis
The first stage of any project is drawing the Block Diagram, which allows you to visualize the overall picture of the designed system, where you can see the component blocks and the connections between them.

## Original Block Diagram
The original Block Diagram of the SAP-1 Computer can be found in the book "Digital Computer Electronics" by Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown, on page 141 and is labeled Figure 10-1.

In the following figure, I present a reproduction of the original Block Diagram of the SAP-1 Computer.
